# How to install NEURON on your machine

These are quick-and-dirty install instructions for having Neuron-Python installed
on your local machine. Please refer to https://www.neuron.yale.edu for more 
detailed information. See particularly: https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/release-9.0


Assuming you do NOT already have a Python installation on your machine, do 
install python as instructed here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Then, follow these instructions (depending on the operating system you are on):

## Windows 
1. Open https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download with your web browser. 
2. Click on -  Download Windows installer (64 bit).
3. Install NEURON and make sure to select "Set DOS environment. (Useful if ...)" when asked to select components to install.


## macOS
1. Open https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download with your web browser. 
2. Click on -  Download OSX installer.
3. Install NEURON and click YES to all questions.


## Linux
1. Open https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download with your web browser. 
2. Download the NEURON installer which fits your linux distribution (.dep or .rpm).
3. Install NEURON
4. Open a terminal window.
5. Type:
echo  'export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/nrn/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH' >> ~/.bashrc



To test that NEURON was installed correctly open jupyter notebook or any python 
shell and check if the following commands are working, by executing these two
python statements:

from neuron import gui
from neuron import h



## Troubleshooting:

1. (Ubuntu) - Can not compile mod files with nrnivmodl, get "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lncurses"
  Solution: 
    you need to install ncurses development, in ubuntu this is how to install it:
                              sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
